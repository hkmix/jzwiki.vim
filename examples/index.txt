*index*  `<-- this is just an anchor to link to`

# Features

  - You can {bold}, _underline_, /italicize/ text (if your terminal supports it).
  - Backticks dims text, but can be used to `show_code_snippets`.
  - [ ] Checkboxes can be toggled, try {<Leader>tt} on this line.
    - [x] They look like this when toggled
  - You can link to |another_file|.
    - Jumping to the link is just like in vim help, with {<C-]>}.
    - If that file doesn't exist, put the cursor on the link and use {<Leader>hC} to create it automatically.
    - Just remember to {<Leader>ht} to update the helptags once the file is created.

# Other features

Here is a fenced block:

```vim
if g:said_hello = 0
  echo 'Hello, world!'
  let g:said_hello = 1
endif
```
